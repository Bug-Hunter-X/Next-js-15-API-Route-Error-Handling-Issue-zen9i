# Next.js 15 API Route Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 API routes where errors during asynchronous operations are not handled gracefully, resulting in a generic 500 Internal Server Error.

The `data.js` file shows the problematic code. The `dataSolution.js` file provides a solution that handles the error properly and returns a meaningful error response to the client.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd nextjs-api-error
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Problem

The original `fetchData` function throws an error randomly.  The API route doesn't catch this, leading to a 500 error. 

## Solution

The solution uses a `try...catch` block to handle the potential error in `fetchData`. If an error occurs, it sends a custom error response with an appropriate status code and error message.
